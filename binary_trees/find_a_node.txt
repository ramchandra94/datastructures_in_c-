For a given Binary Tree of type integer and a number X, find whether a node exists in the tree with data X or not.
 Input Format:
The first and the only line of input will contain the node data, all separated by a single space. Since -1 is used as an indication whether the left or right node data exist for root, it will not be a part of the node data.
Output Format:
The only line of output prints 'true' or 'false'.
Note:
You are not required to print anything explicitly. It has already been taken care of.
Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5
Where N is the total number of nodes in the binary tree.

Time Limit: 1 sec
